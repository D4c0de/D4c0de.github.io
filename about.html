            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Marcin, a passionate programmer with a strong curiosity for how things work and a drive to create solutions that make life easier. My journey in programming began a few years ago, and ever since, I've been exploring the intricacies of coding, primarily in C++ and C#. From building console applications to working on desktop tools, I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code.</p>

            <p>Beyond programming, I have a solid foundation in database management and web development. I find joy in learning and tackling new challenges, especially in areas like version control (Git) and collaborative projects. My knack for communication and teamwork has been honed through various experiences, both professional and personal.</p>

            <h2>What I Love</h2>
            <p>Programming isn't just a skill, it's my passion. I thrive on solving problems and creating tools that add value to the world. When I'm not coding, I dedicate my time to volunteering with a scout team. Over the years, I've taken on responsibilities like managing teams, organizing large-scale events, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. This experience taught me leadership, planning, and adaptability—skills I bring to every aspect of my life.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm fascinated by cars, not just driving them but understanding their inner workings. From diagnostics and mechanics to tuning, I love diving into the details and finding ways to enhance performance. Whether it's brainstorming solutions to a programming challenge or working under the hood of a car, I enjoy hands-on problem-solving and continuous learning.</p>

            <p>I also take pride in staying adaptable and open to learning. Every project, whether big or small, is an opportunity to grow and refine my skills.</p>
